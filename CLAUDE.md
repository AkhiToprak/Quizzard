# CLAUDE.md — Frontend Website Rules

## Project Structure

- **The Next.js app lives in `quizzard/`** (lowercase) — the working directory is `/Users/toprakdemirel/Entwicklung/Quizzard/quizzard/`.
- The root `Quizzard/` (capital Q) contains only: `CLAUDE.md`, `brand_assets/`, `Dockerfile`, and other non-app files.
- All source files, `app/`, `src/`, `package.json`, etc. are under `Quizzard/quizzard/`.
- Brand assets are at `Quizzard/brand_assets/` (one level up from the app).
- When running commands (e.g. `npm run dev`, `npx`, etc.), always `cd` into `Quizzard/quizzard/` first.

## Always Do First

- **Invoke the `frontend-design` skill** before writing any frontend code, every session, no exceptions.

## Reference Images

- If a reference image is provided: match layout, spacing, typography, and color exactly. Swap in placeholder content (images via `https://placehold.co/`, generic copy). Do not improve or add to the design.
- If no reference image: design from scratch with high craft (see guardrails below).
- Screenshot your output, compare against reference, fix mismatches, re-screenshot. Do at least 2 comparison rounds. Stop only when no visible differences remain or user says so.

## Local Server

- **Always serve on localhost** — never screenshot a `file:///` URL.
- Start the dev server: `node serve.mjs` (serves the project root at `http://localhost:3000`)
- `serve.mjs` lives in the project root. Start it in the background before taking any screenshots.
- If the server is already running, do not start a second instance.

## Screenshot Workflow

- Puppeteer is installed at `C:/Users/nateh/AppData/Local/Temp/puppeteer-test/`. Chrome cache is at `C:/Users/nateh/.cache/puppeteer/`.
- **Always screenshot from localhost:** `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000`
- Screenshots are saved automatically to `./temporary screenshots/screenshot-N.png` (auto-incremented, never overwritten).
- Optional label suffix: `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000 label` → saves as `screenshot-N-label.png`
- `screenshot.mjs` lives in the project root. Use it as-is.
- After screenshotting, read the PNG from `temporary screenshots/` with the Read tool — Claude can see and analyze the image directly.
- When comparing, be specific: "heading is 32px but reference shows ~24px", "card gap is 16px but should be 24px"
- Check: spacing/padding, font size/weight/line-height, colors (exact hex), alignment, border-radius, shadows, image sizing

## Output Defaults

- Single `index.html` file, all styles inline, unless user says otherwise
- Tailwind CSS via CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- Placeholder images: `https://placehold.co/WIDTHxHEIGHT`
- Mobile-first responsive

## Brand Assets

- Always check the `brand_assets/` folder before designing. It may contain logos, color guides, style guides, or images.
- If assets exist there, use them. Do not use placeholders where real assets are available.
- If a logo is present, use it. If a color palette is defined, use those exact values — do not invent brand colors.

## Anti-Generic Guardrails

- **Colors:** Never use default Tailwind palette (indigo-500, blue-600, etc.). Pick a custom brand color and derive from it.
- **Shadows:** Never use flat `shadow-md`. Use layered, color-tinted shadows with low opacity.
- **Typography:** Never use the same font for headings and body. Pair a display/serif with a clean sans. Apply tight tracking (`-0.03em`) on large headings, generous line-height (`1.7`) on body.
- **Gradients:** Layer multiple radial gradients. Add grain/texture via SVG noise filter for depth.
- **Animations:** Only animate `transform` and `opacity`. Never `transition-all`. Use spring-style easing.
  use the 21stDev mcp server to get animation inspirations, don't let 21stdev generate new animations, JUST USE INSPIRATIONS, inspirations are in https://21st.dev/community/components
- **Interactive states:** Every clickable element needs hover, focus-visible, and active states. No exceptions.
- **Images:** Add a gradient overlay (`bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60`) and a color treatment layer with `mix-blend-multiply`.
- **Spacing:** Use intentional, consistent spacing tokens — not random Tailwind steps.
- **Depth:** Surfaces should have a layering system (base → elevated → floating), not all sit at the same z-plane.

## Implementation Approach

- **Break work into small phases** — implement one phase at a time, verify before moving on.
- **Use subagents** for complex or parallel tasks to keep the main context clean.
- **Ask questions** when things are uncertain or big decisions need to be made — don't assume.
- **Follow plans strictly** when a plan document is provided (e.g. `tierplan.md`).

## Figma Workflow

- When a Figma URL (`figma.com/design/...`) is provided, invoke the `figma-implement-design` skill to read and implement the design.
- Always adapt Figma MCP output to Neon Scholar conventions: inline style objects with CSS custom properties, Material Symbols Outlined icons, project font variables.
- For partial updates (e.g., "update just the header"), read the design context, diff against the existing component, and apply only the changed parts. Preserve all existing logic.
- On Education plan — conserve `get_design_context` calls. Use `get_screenshot` for minor visual tweaks and describe changes verbally when possible.
- See `quizzard/.claude/rules/figma-design-system.md` for the full translation rules.

## Hard Rules

- Do not add sections, features, or content not in the reference
- Do not "improve" a reference design — match it
- Do not stop after one screenshot pass
- Do not use `transition-all`
- Do not use default Tailwind blue/indigo as primary color
