/**
 * Markdown-paste support for the notebook editor.
 *
 * Context: TipTap's default clipboard pipeline handles `text/html` via each
 * extension's `parseHTML()` method, but it does nothing with raw markdown
 * syntax. When a user pastes plain-text markdown (e.g. copied from a study
 * guide, terminal, or "copy as markdown" in another app), the literal `#`,
 * `*`, `|`, and `-` characters end up stuck in the document because no
 * extension understands them.
 *
 * The fix is to run pasted plain text through `marked` to produce HTML, then
 * let the existing HTML-paste pipeline do its job. All of the extensions we
 * care about (`ToggleHeading`, StarterKit list/bold/italic/blockquote/hr,
 * `CodeBlockLowlight`, `Table`) already have `parseHTML` rules — we just
 * have to give them HTML to chew on.
 *
 * Two invariants this file relies on:
 *
 *   1. We only run on pure `text/plain` clipboard content. If the clipboard
 *      has `text/html`, a richer pipeline already produced proper markup
 *      and we must not touch it (doing so would strip formatting from a
 *      Google Docs / Notion / web-page paste).
 *
 *   2. The heuristic is deliberately biased toward false-positives. The
 *      failure mode of "converted a paragraph that happened to contain
 *      **bold**" is a minor cosmetic surprise; the failure mode of "raw `#`
 *      characters stuck in the doc forever" is the exact bug we're fixing.
 *      When in doubt, convert.
 *
 * `ToggleHeading.parseHTML` (src/lib/tiptap-toggle-heading.ts:87-99) only
 * matches `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>`. Anything deeper that `marked` produces
 * would be silently dropped by TipTap — so we demote `<h4>`/`<h5>`/`<h6>`
 * down to `<h3>` before handing the HTML off. Users keep the hierarchy they
 * can, deeper levels collapse onto the deepest toggle-heading level.

/**
 * Convert markdown source to an HTML string suitable for TipTap's
 * HTML-paste pipeline. Uses `marked` with GFM enabled (tables, strike-
 * through, etc.).
 *
 * Headings need special handling: `ToggleHeading` defines per-attribute
 * `parseHTML` functions on `level`/`summary`/`collapsed` that only know
 * how to read the `data-toggle-*` attributes on its own round-trip `div`
 * form. They run AFTER the tag-level `getAttrs` in `parseHTML()` and
 * silently override its return value with defaults when the pasted
 * element is a raw `<h1>`/`<h2>`/`<h3>` — every heading ends up as
 * level 1 with an empty summary, and the heading text gets dumped into
 * the toggle body instead of the summary bar.
 *
 * To sidestep that, we pre-transform every `<h1>`-`<h6>` in marked's
 * output into the canonical `<div data-toggle-level=".." data-toggle-
 * summary="..">` form that the working parse rule expects. `h4`-`h6`
 * collapse onto level 3 (ToggleHeading's deepest level). The empty
 * `<p></p>` body satisfies the node's `block+` content spec without
 * duplicating the heading text inside the toggle.
