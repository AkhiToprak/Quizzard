# Stylus + barrel-button support

**Status:** Implemented in code, verified via code review against the pointer-events spec and Excalidraw v0.18 API. **Not yet tested on real devices** — see the "Device matrix" table below and fill in results as you acquire hardware.

**Source:** `src/components/notebook/InfiniteCanvas.tsx` lines 245–272.
**Shipped in:** commit `77bad8f feat(canvas): reorder toolbar and map stylus barrel button to eraser`.
**Excalidraw version:** `@excalidraw/excalidraw@^0.18.0`.

## What's implemented

On `pointerdown`, if the pointer is a stylus (`pointerType === 'pen'`) AND either the barrel (side) button is held OR the eraser tip is in contact, the active tool is switched to the eraser via Excalidraw's imperative `api.setActiveTool({ type: 'eraser' })`.

Detection rules (from the PointerEvent spec):

| Bit | `buttons` value | Meaning | Triggers eraser? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `1` | Pen tip contacting surface (primary) | No — normal drawing |
| 1 | `2` | Barrel / side button | **Yes** — `e.buttons & 2 === 2` |
| 5 | `32` | Flipped-over eraser tip | **Yes** — `e.buttons & 32 === 32` |

The listener is attached to `document` in the capture phase so it runs before Excalidraw's own pointer handlers. The tool stays on eraser until the user switches back via the toolbar or the `T / P / E / V` keyboard shortcuts — this is intentional and documented in the code comment.

Number-key shortcuts `1 / 2 / 3` are also remapped in the same file (lines 274–318) to `Text / Pen / Eraser`, matching the visual toolbar order.

## Code review (static verification, no physical device)

Line-by-line against the pointer-events spec:

1. **`e.pointerType !== 'pen'` guard** — correct. The three valid values are `'mouse' | 'pen' | 'touch'`. Only `'pen'` should trigger stylus logic. iPadOS reports Apple Pencil as `'pen'`; Chrome reports Wacom and Surface Pen as `'pen'`; touch screens and mice are correctly excluded.

2. **`(e.buttons & 2) === 2`** — correct. Bit 1 of the `buttons` bitmask is the secondary (barrel) button per the W3C Pointer Events spec. The bitwise AND + equality check correctly returns true whenever the barrel is held, regardless of whether the tip is also down (`buttons === 3` = tip + barrel still passes).

3. **`(e.buttons & 32) === 32`** — correct. Bit 5 is the "eraser" button per the spec. Surface Pen reports `buttons === 32` when flipped.

4. **`setActiveTool({ type: 'eraser' })`** — correct per Excalidraw v0.18 types. The signature matches `@excalidraw/excalidraw/types/element/types.ts`.

5. **Capture-phase `document` listener** — runs before Excalidraw's own listener, so the tool switch happens before any drawing would start. Correct.

**No bugs found during code review.** If reports come in of devices where this doesn't work, the likely causes are in the "Known limitations" section below, not the handler code.

Fill in each row as real hardware becomes available. The expected-behavior column is what the code should do based on the spec.

| Device | Browser / OS | Expected | Tested? | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Pencil (any gen) | Safari / iPadOS | **Does not work** — see limitations | ☐ | — |
| Apple Pencil Pro (squeeze) | Safari / iPadOS | **Does not work** — see limitations | ☐ | — |
| Surface Pen (side button) | Edge / Windows | Switches to eraser on button hold | ☐ | — |
| Surface Pen (flip to erase) | Edge / Windows | Switches to eraser on flip | ☐ | — |
| Wacom Intuos + Pro pen | Chrome / macOS | Switches to eraser on barrel press | ☐ | — |
| Wacom Intuos + Pro pen | Chrome / Windows | Switches to eraser on barrel press | ☐ | — |
| S Pen | Samsung Internet / Android | Switches to eraser on side button | ☐ | — |
| Ordinary mouse | any | **Ignored** (pointerType guard) | ☐ | — |
| Finger touch | any touchscreen | **Ignored** (pointerType guard) | ☐ | — |

To test, temporarily add this log at the top of the handler in `InfiniteCanvas.tsx` line 260:

```ts
console.log('[stylus]', e.pointerType, e.buttons.toString(2), e.buttons);
```

Open the canvas, interact with the stylus, check DevTools console. Remove the log before committing.

## Known limitations

### Apple Pencil — hardware has no barrel button

Apple Pencil (all generations through Pro) does not have a barrel button. The squeeze gesture on Apple Pencil Pro and the double-tap gesture on Apple Pencil 2 are **not exposed to web pages by Safari**. There is no JavaScript API to detect them, and no workaround exists short of a native-app wrapper. This is tracked in `project_apple_pencil_deferred.md`.

On iPad, the keyboard shortcut `3` (remapped to Eraser) works as a fallback if the user connects a Bluetooth keyboard.

### Wacom + macOS — driver-dependent

Some Wacom driver versions on macOS report the barrel button as a right-click (`contextmenu` event) instead of setting `buttons` bit 1. This depends on the user's preferences in the Wacom desktop utility. If the barrel button doesn't switch to eraser on a Mac + Wacom setup, the user should check their Wacom preferences → pen button assignment → set it to "Button 2" or "Right-click", NOT "Keystroke".

Chromium has an open issue tracking similar inconsistencies: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=769495

### The eraser never auto-switches back to pen

Intentional. Once the barrel-button-triggered eraser activates, it stays active until the user explicitly switches tools. Rationale: auto-switching on `pointerup` would make batch-erase (hold barrel, wipe several elements) impossible — every release would reset to pen and the next press would be a stroke again.

If user feedback asks for "press-and-hold to erase, release to resume pen", that's a reasonable future enhancement — it would require a separate `pointerup` handler that checks whether the current tool was set by the barrel-button listener (not by the user clicking the toolbar).

## Don't re-flag this as "missing"

This feature has been implemented since commit `77bad8f`. Before reporting it as missing again:

1. Check `src/components/notebook/InfiniteCanvas.tsx` lines 245–272
2. Verify `pointerType === 'pen'` is reaching that handler (add the debug log above)
3. Verify the `buttons` bitmask includes bit 1 or bit 5 for your device
4. Check this doc's "Known limitations" section for driver quirks

If all four check out and it still doesn't work, open a bug with the device, OS, browser version, and the console output from the debug log.
