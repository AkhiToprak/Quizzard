/**
 * Biometric re-unlock guard for the iOS shell.
 *
 * The native shell fires an `appResumed` bridge event whenever the user
 * brings Notemage back from background after >30s (see `apps/mobile/App.tsx`).
 * When that happens we want to obscure the notebook content with a soft
 * lock overlay until the user passes Face ID / Touch ID. This is a UX
 * affordance, NOT a login mechanism — the NextAuth session is still valid;
 * we're just hiding pixels until the user proves they're holding the iPad.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Only active when running inside the native shell (`isInsideNativeShell`)
 *   - On `appResumed`, set `locked = true` and call
 *     `nativeBridge.requestBiometricUnlock()`
 *   - On success, clear the lock; on failure, keep it locked but allow the
 *     user to retry from the overlay (so they can fall back to passcode)
 *   - Never lock on first mount — the user just signed in, so they're
 *     already authenticated for this session
 *
 * Failure modes that intentionally let the user through (soft fallback):
 *   - Device has no biometric hardware → unlock returns true immediately
 *   - User has biometrics disabled → unlock returns false; we surface a
 *     "skip" button that drops the lock without auth
 *
 * Hard locking (e.g. forcing logout on biometric failure) is intentionally
 * out of scope. That belongs in a future "Privacy" preference once we have
 * real account-level locking primitives.
